# EXP 4 Scenario-Based Report Development Utilizing Diverse Prompting Techniques- Lab Scenario: Smart Health Assistant System
# Description: 
## Background:
You are part of a development team working on an AI-based Smart Health Assistant named "MediGuide" that assists elderly patients in managing chronic diseases like diabetes, hypertension, and arthritis. The assistant must provide tailored health advice, medication reminders, daily tips, and emotional support through natural language conversations.

## Objective:
Develop a scenario-based report that demonstrates how diverse prompting techniques (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, role-based, and multi-modal prompts) can be used to optimize MediGuideâ€™s responses in different use cases.

# Algorithm:

### Step 1: Data Collection
1. **Input Data**: Provide the healthcare case data (e.g., symptoms, medical history, test results) in a structured format.
2. **Select AI Tools**: Choose two AI platforms for evaluation: **ChatGPT** and **Claude**.

### Step 2: Apply Different Prompting Techniques
1. **Straightforward Prompts**:
   - Prompt: Provide basic symptoms and request a diagnosis and treatment suggestion.
   - Example Prompt: "The patient presents with shortness of breath, fever, and chest pain. Based on these symptoms, what is the likely diagnosis and treatment?"

2. **Tabular Format Prompting**:
   - Present the data in a table format, listing symptoms, medical history, and test results.
   - Example Prompt: "Hereâ€™s the patient data in a tabular format: [Table with symptoms, medical history, and test results]. Based on this, what would be the likely diagnosis and recommended treatment?"

3. **Missing Word Prompting**:
   - Provide a partially completed sentence and ask the AI to fill in the missing information.
   - Example Prompt: "The patient's likely diagnosis is _____, and the recommended treatment involves _____."

### Step 3: Submit to AI Platforms
1. **Submit Prompt to ChatGPT**: Use the selected prompt with **ChatGPT**.
2. **Submit Prompt to Claude**: Use the same selected prompt with **Claude**.

### Step 4: Collect Responses
1. **ChatGPT Output**: Collect and store ChatGPT's response.
2. **Claude Output**: Collect and store Claude's response.

### Step 5: Evaluation Criteria
1. **Accuracy**: Check if the AI correctly identifies the disease and recommends suitable treatment.
2. **Completeness**: Ensure that the AI's response includes all necessary diagnostic steps and treatment plans.
3. **Simplicity**: Evaluate if the response is easy to understand, especially for non-medical professionals.
4. **Coherence**: Assess if the response is logically structured and follows a clear reasoning process.

### Step 6: Comparative Analysis
1. Compare **ChatGPT** and **Claude** based on the evaluation criteria.
2. Identify strengths and weaknesses of each AI platform in terms of clarity, specificity, and appropriateness of the response.

### Step 7: Generate Report
1. **Tabulate Findings**: Present the results in a table format for easy comparison.
2. **Conclusion**: Summarize the findings, highlighting the best-performing platform for each prompt type.
3. **Recommendations**: Suggest the most effective prompting strategy and platform based on the evaluation.

### Step 8: Reporting
- Output the final evaluation report, including the comparison of accuracy, completeness, simplicity, and coherence for each AI platform.

## ðŸ“š Use Case
# Healthcare Use Case: AI-driven Diagnostics and Recommendations

## Objective:
To compare the effectiveness of three distinct prompt typesâ€”

**Straightforward Prompts**
**Tabular Format Prompting**, 
**Missing Word Prompting**
â€”across two different AI platforms (e.g., **ChatGPT** and **Claude**) for generating healthcare diagnostics and recommendations.

---

## AI Tools Used:
1. **ChatGPT** (GPT-4)
2. **Claude** (Anthropic AI)

---
## Prompts Used:

### 1. **Straightforward Prompts**:
Objective: Directly ask the AI to provide a diagnosis or recommendation based on provided symptoms and patient information.

**Prompt Example**:
"Given the symptoms of high fever (39Â°C), persistent cough, and shortness of breath, provide a possible diagnosis and recommend treatment options."

---

**ChatGPT Output**:
"Based on the symptoms of high fever (39Â°C), persistent cough, and shortness of breath, a possible diagnosis is **pneumonia** or **COVID-19**. It is recommended to administer antiviral or antibiotic treatment depending on the suspected cause. A chest X-ray and blood tests are advised for confirmation."

**Claude Output**:
"The symptoms of high fever (39Â°C), persistent cough, and shortness of breath suggest **viral pneumonia** or **COVID-19**. The recommended course of action is to provide supportive care (fluids, fever management) and consider antiviral treatments. A CT scan and COVID-19 test are recommended."

### 2. **Tabular Format Prompting**:
Objective: Present information in a tabular format for clarity, then ask the AI to analyze and interpret the data.

**Prompt Example**:
"Below is a table with patient symptoms and vital signs. Based on this, provide a diagnosis and suggest treatment options.

| Symptom              | Measurement   |
|----------------------|---------------|
| Temperature          | 39Â°C          |
| Heart Rate           | 105 bpm       |
| Respiratory Rate     | 22 breaths/min|
| Cough                | Persistent    |
| Shortness of Breath  | Present       |

Interpret the data and give a diagnosis."

---

**ChatGPT Output**:
"Based on the provided data:
- Temperature: 39Â°C
- Heart Rate: 105 bpm
- Respiratory Rate: 22 breaths/min
- Persistent Cough and Shortness of Breath

Diagnosis: Likely **pneumonia** or **viral infection**. Further tests such as a chest X-ray and blood cultures are required. Supportive care including hydration and fever control is recommended."

**Claude Output**:
"Analysis of the patient's vital signs and symptoms suggests the diagnosis of **respiratory infection** (potentially pneumonia or COVID-19). Immediate testing (X-ray and blood test) is essential to confirm the condition. Management includes supportive care and possibly antiviral treatment."

### 3. **Missing Word Prompting**:
Objective: Present a partially completed sentence or data and have the AI complete it by filling in the missing words or information.

**Prompt Example**:
"The patient presents with a fever of 39Â°C and a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute. Based on these observations, the diagnosis is most likely ___ (options: pneumonia, influenza, asthma, etc.). Fill in the missing diagnosis and suggest next steps for treatment."

---
**ChatGPT Output**:
"The patient presents with a fever of 39Â°C and a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute. Based on these observations, the diagnosis is most likely **pneumonia**. Treatment should include antibiotics and supportive care, along with further diagnostic tests like a chest X-ray and blood work."

**Claude Output**:
"The patient presents with a fever of 39Â°C and a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute. Based on these observations, the diagnosis is most likely **viral pneumonia**. Immediate antiviral treatment should be considered, along with supportive care and a chest X-ray to confirm the diagnosis."
